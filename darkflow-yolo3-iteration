Install python3, darkflow and other dependencies such as cython, etc
Create virtual environment "darkflow"
LABELING and creating our own DATASET:
LabelImg is a graphical image annotation tool. It is written in Python and uses Qt for its graphical interface.
Annotations are saved as XML files in PASCAL VOC format, the format used by ImageNet. Besdies, it also supports YOLO format.
Link: https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
We used PASCAL VOC dataset as darkflow version is already trained on it. 
We took our own pictures in various banking centers - augmented them to create a good set of 500 pictures in PNG.
Used the labelIMG tool to annotate the pictures with 2 classes - person and pets. 

FLOW:
Edit labels.txt with 2 classes - person, pets
Save pictures in Images folder and annotated files in Annotations folder.
Download weights and files from thtrieu/darkflow trained in PASCAL VOC format
Make sure you have bin and cfg subfolders under Darkflow folder
See link:https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow
Download tiny-yolo-voc.weights (63.5 MB) in darkflow/bin folder
Make sure you have tiny-yolo-voc-cfg under darkflow/cfg folder
Copy the above file and save as myconf-yolo.cfg un the same folder
Open above file & edit only the last 2 layers: Change only classes as 2 and filters as 35 (as 2 + 5 = 7 times 5)

flow --model cfg/myconf-yolo.cfg --load bin/tiny-yolo-voc.weights --train --annotation data/annotations --dataset data/images

This program ran for 1000 epochs (took 3-4 hours in MAC). Still reviewing the output - cost and accuracy. 

Check darkflow/ckpt folder and it has a checkpoint file with requirements to save weights every 250 epochs
It has created myconfig-yolo-250.data, xxx.meta, xxx.index, xxx.profile files for 250, 500, 750, 1000 epochs
Create build_graph files from the model:

flow --model cfg/myconf-yolo.cfg --load -1 --savepb

This creates darakflow/built_graph subfolder with 2 files: myconf-yolo.pb and myconf-yolo.meta
Now, test few pictures with above trained model. Copy few bank pictures we have and load them in darkflow/testrun folder
Now run this command to see if our trained model is able to review the new images and create bounding box on classes. 

flow --pbLoad built_graph/myconf-yolo.pb --metaLoad built_graph/myconf-yolo.meta --imgdir testrun/

Reviewing the results.
